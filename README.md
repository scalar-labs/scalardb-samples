# Scalar DB server Samples
- This repository contains the sample application that will connect to `Scalar DB server` as backend. For using native `Scalar DB` library to connect to `Scalar DB` directly please refer to this document [`Getting Started`](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md).
- `Scalar DB server` is a `gRPC` server that implements Scalar DB interface. More information about `Scalar DB server` can be found [`here`](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/tree/master/docs/scalardb-server.md)

## Our sample application
A simple electronic money cli app which has the following features:
- Charge an `amount` to a `user_id`
- Pay an `amount` from a `user_id` to another `user_id`

## Prerequisites
- Java (OpenJDK 8 or higher)
- Gradle
- Docker, Docker Compose

## Setting up
### Scalar DB server
- In this sample we will use Cassandra as storage for our Scalar DB server. Cassandra will also run along with Scalar DB server in containers. The setting for our Scalar DB server is [`database.properties`](./database.properties)
```
# Comma separated contact points
scalar.db.contact_points=cassandra

# Port number for all the contact points. Default port number for each database is used if empty.
scalar.db.contact_port=9042

# Credential information to access the database
scalar.db.username=cassandra
scalar.db.password=cassandra

# Storage implementation. Either cassandra or cosmos or dynamo or jdbc can be set. Default storage is cassandra.
scalar.db.storage=cassandra
```
- To start our Scalar DB server, we use the below command (please note that we should wait around a bit more than one minute to make sure every container is already up, because Scalar DB container has to wait for Cassandra container to be fully started)
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-cassandra.yml up -d
```
- *For using other databases as backend for Scalar DB server we can change the configuration in [`database.properties`](database.properties) according to [`Getting Started`](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md). After that we can start our `Scalar DB server` using this [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) instead.*
### Scalar DB Client
- Our sample application will connect to `Scalar DB server` via gRPC, the configuration basically has the same format as our server configuration, the difference is we have to change storage to gRPC and transaction manager to gRPC as well. The configuration is [`scalardb-client.properties`](scalardb-client.properties).
```
# Comma separated contact points
scalar.db.contact_points=127.0.0.1

# Port number for all the contact points. Default port number for each database is used if empty.
scalar.db.contact_port=60051

# Credential information to access the database
scalar.db.username=
scalar.db.password=

# Storage implementation
scalar.db.storage=grpc

# The type of the transaction manager
scalar.db.transaction_manager=grpc
```
- Setting up Scalar DB schema: As mentioned in [`Getting started with Scalar DB`](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/blob/master/docs/getting-started-with-scalardb.md) storing and retrieving data in `Scalar DB` can be done using either the `storage` or the `transaction` mode.
    - Our storage schema is  [`emoney-storage-schema.json`](./src/main/resources/emoney-storage-schema.json)
    ```
    {
      "emoney_storage.account": {
        "transaction": false,
        "partition-key": [
          "id"
        ],
        "clustering-key": [],
        "columns": {
          "id": "TEXT",
          "balance": "INT"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    to register schema to our Cassandra instance we run the following command:
    ```
    java -jar tools/scalar-schema-standalone-3.1.0.jar --cassandra -h localhost -u cassandra -p cassandra -f src/main/resources/emoney-storage-schema.json
    ```
    Please note that `scalar-schema-standalone-3.1.0.jar` is the schema registration tool that can be found in [`release`](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/releases) of `Scalar DB`

    - In case using transaction, our schema looks like [`emoney-transaction-schema.json`](src/main/resources/emoney-transaction-schema.json)
    ```
    {
      "emoney_transaction.account": {
        "transaction": true,
        "partition-key": [
          "id"
        ],
        "clustering-key": [],
        "columns": {
          "id": "TEXT",
          "balance": "INT"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    and the registering command is
    ```
    java -jar tools/scalar-schema-standalone-3.1.0.jar --cassandra -h localhost -u cassandra -p cassandra -f src/main/resources/emoney-transaction-schema.json
    ```

## Run our sample
- Scenario:
    - Charge the user `user1` with an amount of 10.
    - Charge the user `user2` with an amount of 20.
    - `user1` pays an amount of 5 to `user2`
  
- Run
    - Storage mode
     ``` 
     # charge user1 with an amount of 10
     ./gradlew run --args="cmd storage charge -a 10 -u user1"
     
     # charge user2 with an amount of 20
     ./gradlew run --args="cmd storage charge -a 20 -u user2"
     
     # pay 5 from user1 to user2
     ./gradlew run --args="cmd storage pay -a 5 -f user1 -t user2"
     ```

    - Transaction mode
     ``` 
     # charge user1 with an amount of 10
     ./gradlew run --args="cmd transaction charge -a 10 -u user1"
     
     # charge user2 with an amount of 20
     ./gradlew run --args="cmd transaction charge -a 20 -u user2"
     
     # pay 5 from user1 to user2
     ./gradlew run --args="cmd transaction pay -a 5 -f user1 -t user2"
     ```
