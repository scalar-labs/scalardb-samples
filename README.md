# Scalar DB Server Samples
This repository contains a sample application that uses Scalar DB server, a gRPC server that implements Scalar DB interface, as a backend. For using the native Scalar DB library, please refer to [Getting Started](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md).
More information about Scalar DB server can be found [here](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/tree/master/docs/scalardb-server.md).

## Sample application
The sample application is a simple electronic money application that has the following features:
- Charge an `amount` to a `user_id`
- Pay an `amount` from a `user_id` to another `user_id`

## Prerequisites
- Java (OpenJDK 8 or higher)
- Gradle
- Docker, Docker Compose

## Set up
### Scalar DB server
In this sample, we will use Cassandra as storage for Scalar DB server. The configuration of Scalar DB server is shown below. (It is also stored in [database.properties](./database.properties))
```
# Comma separated contact points
scalar.db.contact_points=cassandra

# Port number for all the contact points. Default port number for each database is used if empty.
scalar.db.contact_port=9042

# Credential information to access the database
scalar.db.username=cassandra
scalar.db.password=cassandra

# Storage implementation. Either cassandra or cosmos or dynamo or jdbc can be set. Default storage is cassandra.
scalar.db.storage=cassandra
```
To start Scalar DB server, we use the following command. Please note that we should wait around a bit more than one minute because Scalar DB container has to wait for Cassandra container to be fully started.
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-cassandra.yml up -d
```
*For using other databases as the backend for Scalar DB server, we can change the configuration of [database.properties](database.properties) according to [Getting Started](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md). After that we can start Scalar DB server using [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) instead.*

### Scalar DB client
The sample application uses a client that implements Scalar DB interface. Thus, you can configure the client in the same way as the server-side. But, in this case, you need to specify the server as a contact point and `grpc` for the storage and transaction_manager configuration as follows. (it is stored in [scalardb-client.properties](scalardb-client.properties)).
```
# Comma separated contact points
scalar.db.contact_points=127.0.0.1

# Port number for all the contact points. Default port number for each database is used if empty.
scalar.db.contact_port=60051

# Credential information to access the database
scalar.db.username=
scalar.db.password=

# Storage implementation
scalar.db.storage=grpc

# The type of the transaction manager
scalar.db.transaction_manager=grpc
```
Setting up Scalar DB schema: As mentioned in [Getting started with Scalar DB](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/blob/master/docs/getting-started-with-scalardb.md) storing and retrieving data in `Scalar DB` can be done using either the `storage` or the `transaction` mode.

Now you apply the database schema of the sample application as shown below. (It is stored in [emoney-storage-schema.json](./src/main/resources/emoney-storage-schema.json)).
Note that you use non-transactional schema (storage mode) since `transaction` key is set to false.
      
```
{
  "emoney_storage.account": {
    "transaction": false,
    "partition-key": [
      "id"
    ],
    "clustering-key": [],
    "columns": {
      "id": "TEXT",
      "balance": "INT"
    }
  }
}
```
You then apply the schema with the following command. Please note that `scalar-schema-standalone-<version>.jar` is the schema tool that can be found in [releases](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/releases) of Scalar DB. Please select 3.1.0 or higher since Scalar DB server support is added in 3.1.0.

```
java -jar tools/scalar-schema-standalone-<version>.jar --cassandra -h localhost -u cassandra -p cassandra -f src/main/resources/emoney-storage-schema.json
```

You can create a transaction-enabled schema by setting `transaction` to true. (The updated schema is stored in [emoney-transaction-schema.json](src/main/resources/emoney-transaction-schema.json))

```
{
  "emoney_transaction.account": {
    "transaction": true,
    "partition-key": [
      "id"
    ],
    "clustering-key": [],
    "columns": {
      "id": "TEXT",
      "balance": "INT"
    }
  }
}
```

You can apply the schema in the same way as above.

```
java -jar tools/scalar-schema-standalone-<version>.jar --cassandra -h localhost -u cassandra -p cassandra -f src/main/resources/emoney-transaction-schema.json
```

## Run the sample
Scenario:
  - Charge the user `user1` with an amount of 10.
  - Charge the user `user2` with an amount of 20.
  - `user1` pays an amount of 5 to `user2`.

Run
  - Storage mode
   ``` 
   # charge user1 with an amount of 10
   ./gradlew run --args="cmd storage charge -a 10 -u user1"
   
   # charge user2 with an amount of 20
   ./gradlew run --args="cmd storage charge -a 20 -u user2"
   
   # pay 5 from user1 to user2
   ./gradlew run --args="cmd storage pay -a 5 -f user1 -t user2"
   ```

  - Transaction mode
   ``` 
   # charge user1 with an amount of 10
   ./gradlew run --args="cmd transaction charge -a 10 -u user1"
   
   # charge user2 with an amount of 20
   ./gradlew run --args="cmd transaction charge -a 20 -u user2"
   
   # pay 5 from user1 to user2
   ./gradlew run --args="cmd transaction pay -a 5 -f user1 -t user2"
   ```
