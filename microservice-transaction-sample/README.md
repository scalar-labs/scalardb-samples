# Microservice Transaction Sample

This is a sample application for Microservice Transaction that uses Two-phase Commit Transactions in Scalar DB.
You can find more information about Two-phase Commit Transactions in Scalar DB [here](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/tree/master/docs/two-phase-commit-transactions.md).

## Prerequisites
- Java (OpenJDK 8 or higher)
- Gradle
- Docker, Docker Compose

## Sample application

### Overview

There are two microservices called *Customer Service* and *Order Service* based on the [*Database-per-service* pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/database-per-service.html) in this sample application.

Customer Service manages customers' information including credit card information like a credit limit and a credit total.
Order Service is responsible for order operations like placing an order and getting order histories.
Each service has gRPC endpoints. Clients call the endpoints, and the services call the endpoints each other as well.
Customer Service and Order Service uses MySQL and Cassandra through Scalar DB, respectively.

Note that both services access a small coordinator database used for the Consensus Commit protocol.
The database is service-independent and exists for managing transaction metadata for Consensus Commit in a highly available manner, so we don't think it is violating the database-per-service pattern. 
*NOTE: We also plan to create a microservice container for the coordinator database to truly achieve the database-per-service pattern.*

In this sample application, for ease of setup and explanation, we co-locate the coordinator database in the same Cassandra instance of the Order Service, but of course, the coordinator database can be managed as a separate database.

### Schemas

[The schema for Customer Service](customer-service-schema-loader/customer-service-schema.json) is as follows:

```json
{
  "customer_service.customers": {
    "transaction": true,
    "partition-key": [
      "id"
    ],
    "clustering-key": [],
    "columns": {
      "id": "INT",
      "name": "TEXT",
      "credit_limit": "INT",
      "credit_total": "INT"
    }
  }
}
```

The `customer_service.customers` table manages customers' information.
The `credit_limit` for a customer is the maximum amount of money a lender will allow the customer to spend using a credit card,
and the `credit_total` is the amount of money that the customer has already spent by using the credit card.

[The schema for Order Service](order-service-schema-loader/order-service-schema.json) is as follows:

```json
{
  "order_service.orders": {
    "transaction": true,
    "partition-key": [
      "customer_id"
    ],
    "clustering-key": [
      "timestamp"
    ],
    "secondary-index": [
      "id"
    ],
    "columns": {
      "id": "TEXT",
      "customer_id": "INT",
      "timestamp": "BIGINT"
    }
  },
  "order_service.statements": {
    "transaction": true,
    "partition-key": [
      "order_id"
    ],
    "clustering-key": [
      "item_id"
    ],
    "columns": {
      "order_id": "TEXT",
      "item_id": "INT",
      "count": "INT"
    }
  },
  "order_service.items": {
    "transaction": true,
    "partition-key": [
      "id"
    ],
    "clustering-key": [],
    "columns": {
      "id": "INT",
      "name": "TEXT",
      "price": "INT"
    }
  }
}
```

The `order_service.orders` table manages orders' information, and the `order_service.statements` table manages the statements' information of the orders.
The `order_service.items` table manages items' information to be ordered.

The ER diagram for the schema is as follows:

### Transactions

The following five transactions are implemented in this sample application:

1. Getting customer information. It is a transaction in Customer Service
2. Placing an order. It is a transaction that spans Order Service and Customer Service. It first checks if the amount of the money of the order exceeds the credit limit. And when the check is passed, it records order histories and updates the `credit_total`
3. Getting order information by order ID. It is a transaction in Order Service
4. Getting order information by customer ID. It is a transaction in Order Service
5. Repayment. It is a transaction in Customer Service. It reduces the amount of `credit_total`.

## Set up

First, you need to build the docker images of the sample application with the following command:
```
./gradlew docker
```

After that, you need to run the following `docker-compose` command:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

This command starts Cassandra and MySQL and loads the schemas, and starts the microservices.
Please note that you need to wait around more than one minute for the containers to be fully started.

### Initial data

When the microservices start, the initial data is loaded automatically as follows:

- For the `customer_service.customers` table:

| id  | name          | credit_limit | credit_total |
| --- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 1   | Yamada Taro   | 10000        | 0            |
| 2   | Yamada Hanako | 10000        | 0            |
| 3   | Suzuki Ichiro | 10000        | 0            |

- For the `order_service.items` table:

| id  | name   | price |
| --- | ------ | ----- |
| 1   | Apple  | 1000  |
| 2   | Orange | 2000  |
| 3   | Grape  | 2500  |
| 4   | Mango  | 5000  |
| 5   | Melon  | 3000  |

## Run the sample application

Let's start with getting the customer information whose ID is `1`:
```
# ./gradlew :client:run --args="GetCustomerInfo 1"
...
{"id": 1,"name": "Yamada Taro","credit_limit": 10000}
...
```

At this time, `credit_total` isn't shown, which means the current value of `credit_total` is `0`.

Then, place an order for three apples and two oranges with customer ID `1`. Note that the format of order is `<Item ID>:<Count>,<Item ID>:<Count>,...`:
```
# ./gradlew :client:run --args="PlaceOrder 1 1:3,2:2"
...
{"order_id": "4ccdb21c-ac03-4b48-bcb7-cad57eac1e79"}
...
```

The command shows the order ID of the order. 

Let's check the details of the order with the order ID:
```
# ./gradlew :client:run --args="GetOrder 4ccdb21c-ac03-4b48-bcb7-cad57eac1e79"
...
{"order": {"order_id": "4ccdb21c-ac03-4b48-bcb7-cad57eac1e79","timestamp": 1631605253126,"customer_id": 1,"customer_name": "Yamada Taro","statement": [{"item_id": 1,"item_name": "Apple","price": 1000,"count": 3,"total": 3000},{"item_id": 2,"item_name": "Orange","price": 2000,"count": 2,"total": 4000}],"total": 7000}}
...
```

So, let's place an order again and get the order histories by customer ID `1`:
```
# ./gradlew :client:run --args="PlaceOrder 1 5:1"
...
{"order_id": "0b10db66-faa6-4323-8a7a-474e8534a7ee"}
...
# ./gradlew :client:run --args="GetOrders 1"
...
{"order": [{"order_id": "0b10db66-faa6-4323-8a7a-474e8534a7ee","timestamp": 1631605501485,"customer_id": 1,"customer_name": "Yamada Taro","statement": [{"item_id": 5,"item_name": "Melon","price": 3000,"count": 1,"total": 3000}],"total": 3000},{"order_id": "4ccdb21c-ac03-4b48-bcb7-cad57eac1e79","timestamp": 1631605253126,"customer_id": 1,"customer_name": "Yamada Taro","statement": [{"item_id": 1,"item_name": "Apple","price": 1000,"count": 3,"total": 3000},{"item_id": 2,"item_name": "Orange","price": 2000,"count": 2,"total": 4000}],"total": 7000}]}
...
```

These histories are ordered by timestamp in a descending manner.

The current `credit_total` is `10000`, so it has reached the `credit_limit`.
So, the customer can't place an order anymore due to the limit.

```
# ./gradlew :client:run --args="GetCustomerInfo 1"
...
{"id": 1,"name": "Yamada Taro","credit_limit": 10000,"credit_total": 10000}
...
# ./gradlew :client:run --args="PlaceOrder 1 3:1,4:1"
...

        at io.grpc.stub.ClientCalls.getUnchecked(ClientCalls.java:243)

        at picocli.CommandLine.execute(CommandLine.java:1904)
        at example.client.Client.main(Client.java:27)
...
```

After repayment, the customer will be able to place an order again!

```
# ./gradlew :client:run --args="Repayment 1 8000"
...
# ./gradlew :client:run --args="GetCustomerInfo 1"
...
{"id": 1,"name": "Yamada Taro","credit_limit": 10000,"credit_total": 2000}
...
# ./gradlew :client:run --args="PlaceOrder 1 3:1,4:1"
...
{"order_id": "dd53dd9d-aaf4-41db-84b2-56951fed6425"}
...
```

## How the microservice transaction is achieved

So far, we have run the sample application, but we haven't seen how it is implemented.
Let's look at the code to see how the transaction that spans the services is implemented.

When a client sends `Place an order` request to Order Service, [OrderService.placeOrder()](order-service/src/main/java/example/order/OrderService.java#L103-L104) is called, and the microservice transaction starts.

At first, Order Service starts a transaction with [start()](order-service/src/main/java/example/order/OrderService.java#L109-L110):
```java
transaction = twoPhaseCommitTransactionManager.start();
```

Then, Order Service calls the `join` gRPC endpoint of Customer Service along with the transaction ID, and Customer Service joins the transaction with [join()](customer-service/src/main/java/example/customer/CustomerService.java#L161):
```java
twoPhaseCommitTransactionManager.join(request.getTransactionId());
```

After that, CRUD operations happen.

Order Service puts the order information to the `order_service.orders` table also the detailed information to `order_service.statements` (the code is [here](order-service/src/main/java/example/order/OrderService.java#L116-L129)):
```java
Order.put(transaction, orderId, request.getCustomerId(), System.currentTimeMillis());

int amount = 0;
for (ItemOrder itemOrder : request.getItemOrderList()) {
  Statement.put(transaction, orderId, itemOrder.getItemId(), itemOrder.getCount());

  Optional<Item> item = Item.get(transaction, itemOrder.getItemId());
  if (!item.isPresent()) {
    responseObserver.onError(
        Status.NOT_FOUND.withDescription("Item not found").asRuntimeException());
    return;
  }
  amount += item.get().price * itemOrder.getCount();
}
```

And, Order Service calls the `payment` gRPC endpoint of Customer Service along with the transaction ID.
This endpoint first resumes the transaction and gets the customer information.
It then checks if the customer's credit total exceeds the credit limit after the payment.
And if the check is okay, it updates the customer's credit total (the code is [here](customer-service/src/main/java/example/customer/CustomerService.java#L175-L197)):
```java
TwoPhaseCommitTransaction transaction =
    twoPhaseCommitTransactionManager.resume(request.getTransactionId());

Optional<Customer> result = Customer.get(transaction, request.getCustomerId());

if (!result.isPresent()) {
  responseObserver.onError(
      Status.NOT_FOUND.withDescription("Customer not found").asRuntimeException());
  return;
}

int updatedCreditTotal = result.get().creditTotal + request.getAmount();

// Check if the credit total exceeds the credit limit after payment
if (updatedCreditTotal > result.get().creditLimit) {
  responseObserver.onError(
      Status.FAILED_PRECONDITION
          .withDescription("Credit limit exceeded")
          .asRuntimeException());
  return;
}

Customer.updateCreditTotal(transaction, request.getCustomerId(), updatedCreditTotal);
```

Once Order Service receives that the payment succeeded, Order Service tries to commit the transaction.

To do that, Order Service starts with [preparing the transaction](order-service/src/main/java/example/order/OrderService.java#L134).
Order Service calls `prepare()` of its transaction object and calls the `prepare` gRPC endpoint of Customer Service (the code is [here](order-service/src/main/java/example/order/OrderService.java#L189-L190)):
```java
transaction.prepare();
stub.prepare(PrepareRequest.newBuilder().setTransactionId(transaction.getId()).build());
```

In this endpoint, Customer Service calls `prepare()` of its transaction object, as well (the code is [here](customer-service/src/main/java/example/customer/CustomerService.java#L214)):
```java
TwoPhaseCommitTransaction transaction =
    twoPhaseCommitTransactionManager.resume(request.getTransactionId());
transaction.prepare();
```

Similarly, Order Service and Customer Service call `validate()` of their transaction objects (the codes are [here](order-service/src/main/java/example/order/OrderService.java#L194) and [here](customer-service/src/main/java/example/customer/CustomerService.java#L228-L230)).
For the details of `validate()`, see [this document](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/blob/master/docs/two-phase-commit-transactions.md#validate-the-transaction).

When preparing the transaction succeeds in both Order Service and Customer Service, we can [commit the transaction](order-service/src/main/java/example/order/OrderService.java#L143).
Order Service calls `commit()` of its transaction object, and then calls the `commit` gRPC endpoint of Customer Service (the code is [here](order-service/src/main/java/example/order/OrderService.java#L200-L201)):
```java
transaction.commit();
stub.commit(CommitRequest.newBuilder().setTransactionId(transaction.getId()).build());
```

In this endpoint, Customer Service calls `commit()` of its transaction object, as well (the code is [here](customer-service/src/main/java/example/customer/CustomerService.java#L244-L246)):
```java
TwoPhaseCommitTransaction transaction =
    twoPhaseCommitTransactionManager.resume(request.getTransactionId());
transaction.commit();
```

When some error happens during the transaction, we need to [rollback the transaction](order-service/src/main/java/example/order/OrderService.java#L153).
In this case, Order Service calls `rollback()` of its transaction object, and then calls the `rollback` gRPC endpoint of Customer Service (the code is [here](order-service/src/main/java/example/order/OrderService.java#L209-L210)):
```java
transaction.rollback();
stub.rollback(RollbackRequest.newBuilder().setTransactionId(transaction.getId()).build());
```

In this endpoint, Customer Service calls `rollback()` of its transaction object, as well (the code is [here](customer-service/src/main/java/example/customer/CustomerService.java#L260-L262)):
```java
TwoPhaseCommitTransaction transaction =
    twoPhaseCommitTransactionManager.resume(request.getTransactionId());
transaction.rollback();
```
